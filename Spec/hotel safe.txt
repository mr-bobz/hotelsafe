Please find attached an image of the Hotel Safe App. It’s a simple exercise for us to get a view of where you’re at, your thought process and how you organize/commit code so you don’t need to spend a lot of time on it. Please set up a git repo and commit to it as you progress through the code base.

An explanation of the application is below:

Hotel Safe App

The application is a basic representation of a hotel safe where you input a PIN, the safe locks with the stored PIN and you open it again by inputting the correct PIN. The rules are as follows:

1) PIN should be 4 digits
2) PIN should show each digit in display on key press with a limit of 4
3) Enter button should store the PIN code IF the safe is not currently locked
4) If the safe is locked on enter, show an error message (eg. INVALID) in the display window
5) If safe is open and PIN is a valid 4 digit value, save value to state and use that to update lock indicator light
6) If safe is locked and PIN matches stored value, unlock and update indicator light and clear state value/display
7) Currently open safe should display a green light, locked should display a red light
8) CLR should clear the current display

Use css, sass or styled components as you see fit to make the app look as close as you can to the included image.
Use https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app as a framework to build the app. Keep in mind that we use React with Redux. It’s a pure frontend application so you don’t need to do any service calls etc.

Bonus points for:
- enzyme or jest unit tests.
- Responsiveness - ability to use on a mobile device
